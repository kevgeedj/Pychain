# PyChain

A secure and transparent digital record-keeping system built on Python technology. It ensures the integrity and immutability of data through cryptographic techniques, providing a reliable and tamper-proof way to track transactions and information updates. PyChain's design emphasizes efficiency and ease of use, making it a versatile solution for applications requiring robust data management and accountability.

1. **Record Transactions:** PyChain allows for the recording of financial transactions with sender, receiver, and amount details.
2. **Block Mining:** Blocks in PyChain are mined using a simple proof-of-work algorithm. The difficulty of the algorithm can be adjusted in the user interface.
3. **Blockchain Validation:** PyChain incorporates a validation mechanism to ensure the integrity of the blockchain.
4. **User Interface:** PyChain utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive user interface for viewing the blockchain and adding new transactions.

## Streamlit Interface

1. In the terminal, navigate to the folder of `pychain.py`, run the Streamlit application by using `streamlit run pychain.py`

3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the Add Block button.

4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit dropdown menu. 

5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
